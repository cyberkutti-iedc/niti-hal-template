## 🚀 Getting Started  

Follow these steps to quickly set up your development environment:  

### 1️⃣ Install Required Tools  

Ensure you have the following tools installed:  

- **[`cargo-generate`]**: A Rust project generator for templated workflows.  
- **[`waterman`]**: A tool to seamlessly flash your board using the `cargo` workflow.  

```bash
cargo install cargo-generate
cargo install waterman
```

### 2️⃣ Create Your Project  

Run the following command to generate your project from this template:  

```bash
cargo generate --git https://github.com/cyberkutti-iedc/niti-hal-template.git
```  

You’ll be prompted to select your target board. **For the best experience, select "Niti V1 Board" as your board.**

## 🛠️ Build & Flash  

Once your project is created, building and flashing is straightforward:  

```bash
# Build and flash the firmware
cargo run
```  

If everything is set up correctly, you should see your program running on the board!
